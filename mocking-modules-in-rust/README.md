# Mocking Modules in Rust (Vero)

My name is Vero, I work as a Software Engineer at [MaibornWolff](https://www.maibornwolff.de/)

In this session I was looking for help with mocking functionality from modules in Rust. And I found help!!!

We came up with a few different ways of achieving this, which are documented in the following repo: https://github.com/veronika-hillebrand-mw/rust-testing-mock-modules

Thanks to the kind rustaceans, who taught me how to do it and made me understand Traits a little better ❤️
